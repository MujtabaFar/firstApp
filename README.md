# Velomichi - Mobile Bicycle Repair

A single-page website showcasing a mobile bicycle repair service. All content is static, so no database or server is required.

## Running Locally

npx serve public
```
Then visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the port printed).

## Customizing
- Replace the placeholder images with your own high quality photos. Unsplash offers great free images.
- Update `script.js` if you want to integrate a real backend for the contact form.
